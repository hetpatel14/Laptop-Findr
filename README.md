# Laptop-Findr
Laptop-Findr was created keeping in mind our audience as the new students or the people who are not into computers. Sometimes it becomes difficult to find the laptop with the configuration that one wants. Therefore me and my group decided to build something that will not only help us learn building websites but we will also be able to help the community.

Laptop-Findr is mainly built using HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript. We also made use of the Noteb.com's API to get the data of all the laptops.
I malinly worked on the back-end for pages like login, signup, contact-us, changePassword

Our website is hosted on: https://patel1ik.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/Final/public_html/index.php
